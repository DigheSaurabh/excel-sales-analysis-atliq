# Excel Sales & Finance Analytics Project – AtliQ Hardwares  

### 📌 Project Objective  
AtliQ Hardwares, a global computer hardware company (PCs, peripherals, and accessories), needed to **consolidate scattered sales and finance data** into one unified reporting system.  
The leadership team wanted **faster, insight-driven decisions** instead of static Excel reports from regional managers.  

As a **Data Analyst**, my role was to:  
- Organize and transform 4 years of unstructured sales data (~50K+ records).  
- Build automated, refreshable dashboards in Excel.  
- Track key KPIs (Net Sales, Gross Margin %, YoY Growth, Contribution by Channel).  
- Surface insights to guide strategy on products, customers, and geographies.

### 🛠 My Approach  
1. **Data Preparation (ETL)**  
   - Cleaned and transformed raw files using **Power Query**.  
   - Built a **star schema data model** linking Fact Sales with Date, Customer, Product, and Market.  
   - Standardized calculations (Net Sales, GM%, YoY).  

2. **Analysis & Reporting**  
   - Created Pivot-based dashboards with slicers/timelines.  
   - Designed Profit & Loss reports by **year, month, market, and division**.  
   - Built automated refresh and export using **VBA macros**.  

3. **Business Storytelling**  
   - Segmented customers (Top 10, Mid-tier, Long-tail).  
   - Highlighted high-growth products and underperforming divisions.  
   - Uncovered margin differences across countries and channels.

### 🔑 Key Insights  
- **Customer Concentration:** Top 10 customers contributed ~48% of $598M revenue (Amazon alone $82M). → Diversification needed.  
- **Division Performance:** P&A division is the revenue engine ($338M, 221% YoY), while N&S underperformed.  
- **Product Growth:** Top 10 products grew **+708%**, validating R&D investments.  
- **Geography:** India led in revenue ($161M) but had lower margins (33.4%), while smaller markets achieved 43–45% GM.  
- **Seasonality:** December sales consistently peaked (~7× March), requiring stronger supply chain planning.

### 📊 Deliverables  
- Automated **Excel dashboards** (ETL + Pivot + VBA).  
- **P&L reports** by year, month, quarter, and market.  
- Executive-ready **PowerPoint deck** summarizing findings.  
- Clear documentation of **KPI definitions and methodology**.
